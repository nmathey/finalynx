Finalynx - Tutorial 7 - Define your portfolio structure (basics)
================================================================

This tutorial shows how to define your portfolio structure in your configuration
file. This is the most important part of your configuration and lets you freely
organize your investments in a tree structure.

Try it out by running:
> python3 examples/tutorials/7_structure.py

""" [THE BASICS] ---------------------------------------------------------------
The portfolio structure is defined by creating a tree of `Node` objects (abstract
class). Nodes can be `Line`, `Folder` or `SharedFolder` objects. The root of the
tree must be a `Portfolio` object.

A `Line` object represents a single investment. It can have a name, a symbol and
an amount. The symbol is optional and can be used to fetch data from Finary. The
amount is also optional and can be used to override the amount fetched from Finary.

A `Folder` object can have a name and a list of children. The children can be
Line objects or other Folder objects. This lets you organize your investments
in a completely free structure. Folders can be used to group investments by
type, by account, by risk level, etc depending on your needs.

A `SharedFolder` object is similar to a Folder object but holds a `Bucket` object
instead of a list of children. We'll see how to use them in the next tutorial.
