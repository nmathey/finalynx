Finalynx - Tutorial 10 - Set investment targets for your lines
==============================================================

This tutorial shows how to define investment targets for your lines. For each node
in the portfolio tree, you can set various types of targets to help you reach your
investment goals. These targets include:
- `TargetRange`: a range of values that you want to reach for a given line.
- `TargetMin` and `TargetMax`: a minimum and maximum value that you want to maintain.
- `TargetRatio`: a ratio that this `Node` must represent in the parent `Folder`.
- `TargetGlobalRatio`: a ratio that this `Node` must represent in the entire portfolio.


See the online documentation for the list of available targets:
> https://github.com/MadeInPierre/finalynx/blob/main/finalynx/portfolio/targets.py

Try it out by running:
> python3 examples/tutorials/10_targets.py

Use the `target` argument to set a target for a line of folder. In this example,
fake `amount` values are simply used to show a nice result if you run this code.
